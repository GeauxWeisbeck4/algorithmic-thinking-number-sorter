# Algorithmic Thinking Number Sorter

This project was created while I have been working on completing the FreeCodeCamp.org JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms courses and challenges. The project for Learn Algorithmic Thinking by Building a Number Sorter helped me learn and understand the Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort by visualizing them on the console.
